"""
Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print 
out the name of each animal.

- Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as, 'A dog
would make a great pet.'

- Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common.
You could print a sentence such as 'Any of these animals would make a great pet!'

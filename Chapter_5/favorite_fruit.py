Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of
independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.

- make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
- write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of 
fruit is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should
print a statement, such as 'You really like bananas!'
